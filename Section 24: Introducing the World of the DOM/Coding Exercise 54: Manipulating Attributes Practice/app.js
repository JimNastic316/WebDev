// Let's get some practice working with DOM element attributes. 
// I've provided you with some very basic markup.  
// Please select the image element and:

//     change its source to this url: https://devsprouthosting.com/images/chicken.jpg

//     change its alt text to be "chicken"

const imageElement = document.querySelector('img');
imageElement.src = 'https://devsprouthosting.com/images/chicken.jpg';
imageElement.alt = 'chicken';
